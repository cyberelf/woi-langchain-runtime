This is yet another agent framework, but it's a framework unlike langchain/langgraph, ADK etc. The target of this project is not to provide a SDK of agent development for professional developers only, but a platform for the cooperation of software engineers and prompt engineers.

To do so, we introduced a concept of agent template. Software engineer can develop a agent template using any framework they like simular to a traditional agent development, and leave some business related prompts blank. Prompt engineers can fill these blanks and the system generates new agents from the selected tempate.

There are also some simular tools like Defy which can let business guys to do their configuration and prompting, so what's the difference? The major differences are:
1. Workflow is never a first class citizen in our system, because we believe it's an old concept born for the 'lowcode' eara, and instead of enable non-technical people to make programs, it blurs the boundary of coding and business and creates a lot of deeply entangled systems. On the opposite, our target is maintain a clear boundary between coding and business by using agent template to encapsulate all the code logics, and also leave natural language logic to the upper layer.
2. Unlike the hidden agent logic in those platforms, our agent template are extensible. Developers can create your own template other than ReAct agent and enables prompt engineers on different areas.
