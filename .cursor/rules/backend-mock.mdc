# Backend Data Mocking Structure

All backend data mocks must be organized in the `data` directory using JSON files. This ensures:

1. Clear separation between mock data and application logic
2. Easy switching between mock data and real backend server
3. Consistent data structure across development

## File Structure
- All mock data should be placed in `[data/](mdc:data)` directory
- Each entity type should have its own JSON file (e.g., `users.json`, `products.json`)
- Mock data files should mirror the real API response structure

## Usage Guidelines
- Use file reading backend service to fetch mock data
- Implement data access through service layer

- Keep mock data format consistent with API specifications
