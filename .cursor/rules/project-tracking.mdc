# Project Tracking Guidelines

Development progress must be tracked and aligned with requirements documentation:

## Implementation Tracking
- All progress must be documented in `[IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKING.md](mdc:IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKING.md)`
- Update tracking document for each completed feature
- Include status, completion date, and any notable challenges
- Track both completed and pending tasks
- Check for existing content before changing and make sure the file is consistant

## Requirements Alignment
- All implementations must align with `[REQUIREMENTS.md](mdc:REQUIREMENTS.md)`
- Verify feature implementation against requirements
- Document any deviations from requirements with justification
- Keep requirements document as source of truth

## API Consistancy
- Frontend and backend should follow `@API_SPECIFICATION.md`
- Update `@API_SPECIFICATION.md` when API changes

## Progress Updates
- Regular updates to tracking document
- Clear status indicators for each component
- Link implementations to specific requirements

- Note any blockers or dependencies
